# Hi, I'm Muttraf ðŸ‘‹

Hello everyone! My name is Muhammad Muttraf Rasool, and I have a goal to work as a full-stack developer for a big tech company one day. Currently, I am working as a React Js developer where I use JavaScript, React, and HTML since July of this year, and I am also studying at Microverse, an online training school where I code 8 hours a day remotely with other developers and have learned the skills of communication and teamwork. I am really excited about the opportunity to work remotely with a strong tech company, and I am proud of the steps I am taking to achieve this.
